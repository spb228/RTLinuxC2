RTLinux Project: Real-time Command & Status Monitor

Concept: A user-space application sends simple commands to a real-time kernel module. The kernel module processes these commands in a real-time context, updates an internal "status" or "state," and periodically pushes this updated status back to the user-space application for display.

This project demonstrates:

    Kernel-to-User Communication: Real-time data from kernel to user space.

    User-to-Kernel Communication: Commands from user space to the real-time context.

    Real-time Tasks: Creating and managing periodic tasks.

    RT-FIFOs: The primary RTLinux communication mechanism.

    Simulated Real-time Logic: Performing simple, time-sensitive "work" within the kernel.
